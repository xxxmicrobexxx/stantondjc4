This is a custom controller file for the Stanton DJC4 controller with Mixxx DJ software.  You should add it to your "User Mapping Folder" which for me is at C:\Users\(user)\AppData\Local\Mixxx\controllers - you can find yours by going to preferences > controllers > open user mapping folder (in the right pane)


* Beat loop roll = Shift-beat multiplier (fx select) enables.  My Deck 2 beat multiplier button/knob (top right corner) is broken, so I have mapped it to the adjacent FX Select button/knob 
* Auto DJ enable/disable = TX/FX button (in centre above VU meters)
* AutoDJ fade to next track = shift + TX/FX button

There may be other changes to make the mapping suit me better.
