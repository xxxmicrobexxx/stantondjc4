This is a custom controller for the Stanton DJC4 controller with Mixxx DJ software.

As well as improving the mapping generally, my Deck 2 beat multiplier button/knob (top right corner) is broken, so I have mapped it to the adjacent FX Select button/knob.

I have also mapped the Auto DJ enable/disable to the Deck 1 scratch button and the Auto DJ crossfade to shift-scratch.
