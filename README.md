This is a custom controller for the Stanton DJC4 controller with Mixxx DJ software.

My Deck 2 beat multiplier button/knob (top right corner) is broken, so I have mapped it to the adjacent FX Select button/knob 
* Beat loop roll = Shift-beat multiplier (fx select) enables .
* Auto DJ enable/disable = TX/FX button (in centre above VU meters)
* AutoDJ fade to next track = shift + TX/FX button

There may be other changes to make the mapping suit me better.
